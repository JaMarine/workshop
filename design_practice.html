<h1>2021-2022 Praxis Charter (Version 1.0)</h1>

<p> We acknowledge that the land where we learn and work is the ancestral homeland and traditional territory of the Monacan Indian Nation. We pay respect to their elders and knowledge keepers – past and present. We acknowledge and pay respect to the enslaved Africans, enslaved laborers, and free Black laborers who built the University of Virginia, as well as their descendants </p>

<h4> This charter is a living document that will evolve as we grow together as a community. As is the case with all collective endeavors, many people and places nourish and inform our desire to cultivate accessible and equitable spaces of collective care, playful experimentation, and common good. Our acknowledgements section credits their contributions. </h4>

<h2> Ethos </h2>
<ul>
    <li>We will decenter performance and rigor in favor of generosity, joy, and experimentation. </li>
    <li>We will foster a communal space that disarms anxiety, depression, and alienating siloes, and, instead, foregrounds vulnerability. Although vulnerability can often cause one to recoil in fear, self-preservation, and paranoia, we see it as a place of potential, growth, and becoming. </li>
    <li>We will create an alternative space where failure is not feared but encouraged. We want to practice what Jack Halberstam coined as “the queer art of failure”: an understanding that failure, forgetfulness, and “stupidity” are weapons against harmful hegemonic systems. Our answers to questions like “What is success?” and “What is failure?” are therefore the same, for we welcome the lessons that our successes and failures teach us, and recognize that each of us are inherently capable and worthy individuals in spite of, and because of, them.</li>
</ul>

<h2> Routine </h2>
<ul>
    <li> We will establish a concrete time and place to meet up as a team every week, and commit to attending and participating in those meetings (preferably in-person). </li>
    <li>The first thing we will do any time we meet is check-in with one another. Our physical, mental, and emotional health should always come first.</li>
    <li>We will regularly check-in about our assigned tasks and share updates about our individual goals.</li>
    <li> We will promote flexibility according to our schedules and individual needs, like keeping our “stressors calendar” updated and regularly communicating about impending events or tasks in our studies and/or lives. </li>
    <li> We will make time to socialize –– where we all meet for a drink and not talk about work (as long as it won’t create more stress). </li>
</ul>

<h2> Colloboration </h2>

<h4> To love each other even when we hate each other. </h4>
<ul>
    <li>We will emphasize empathy in all practices and processes of collaboration.</li>
    <li>We will learn to identify toxicity within ourselves and others.</li>
    <li>We will hold each other accountable in prioritizing our well-being.</li>
    <li>We acknowledge and credit all contributions to our work based on the [Collaborators Bill of Rights] (https://archive.mith.umd.edu/offthetracks/recommendations/). </li>
    <li>We will practice “calling in” rather than “calling out,” and accept constructive criticism and editing as acts of love and respect. </li>
    <li>We will formally ask each individual for their thoughts when making a decision, rather than assuming that silence means agreement. We will handle disputes promptly rather than allowing anything to fester, and value dissenting opinions. Following the footsteps of Audre Lorde, we will accept that difference is not only an ever-present part of any collaboration, but that working through the tensions between our differences is also key to personal growth and the development of our group. </li>
    <li>We will remember to chill: a 10-hour commitment is a 10-hour commitment.</li>
</ul>

Sin kakan malitiam dixisses, ad aliud nos unum certum vitium consuetudo Latina traduceret.
Nos paucis ad haec additis finem faciamus aliquando;
Sine ea igitur iucunde negat posse se vivere?
Si est nihil nisi corpus, summa erunt illa: valitudo, vacuitas doloris, pulchritudo, cetera.
Addo etiam illud, multa iam mihi dare signa puerum et pudoris et ingenii, sed aetatem vides.
Tum ille: Tu autem cum ipse tantum librorum habeas, quos hic tandem requiris?
Nam si quae sunt aliae, falsum est omnis animi voluptates esse e corporis societate.
Negare non possum.
Bonum liberi: misera orbitas.
